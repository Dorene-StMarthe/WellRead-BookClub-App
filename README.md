# WellRead-BookClub-App
The central focus for this app is to be a hub for a bookclub or for someone who wants to keep track of their reading. Divided into the categories, "Books Read", "Currently Reading" and "Want to Read", users will be able to add and delete books to their inventory, in addition to edit and update descriptions in a form.

General App Idea/Purpose
